This is an Apache module that loads and runs Nu code.

It is very preliminary, currently just a test of feasibility, 
but it works!  Nu code is loaded and evaluated by an Apache 
module that I've written in Objective-C.  I've tested it on 
Leopard Server. It requires a x86_64 build of Nu to run with 
the default httpd.

mod_nu is released under the Apache License, version 2.0.

	$ sudo gdb /usr/sbin/apache2 
	...
	(gdb) run -X
